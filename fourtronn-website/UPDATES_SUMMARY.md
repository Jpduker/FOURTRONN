## 🆘 Backend Question:

You asked: *"How will staff know when we have an order? Can we send an email to process the order?"*

**Answer: YES!** That's exactly what I just built! 

Once you add the Resend API key:
- Every order automatically emails `leninups@gmail.com`
- Email includes ALL order details
- Your dad can process from email
- No database needed for MVP

**Later (for full backend):**
- Supabase database (save all orders permanently)
- Admin dashboard (view/manage all orders)
- Inventory tracking
- Order status updates
- But email notifications work NOW!

---

## 📱 Current Workflow:

1. Customer browses & adds to cart ✅
2. Customer checks out ✅  
3. Order logged to terminal ✅
4. Order emailed to leninups@gmail.com ✅ (needs API key)
5. Your dad processes order 👨‍💼

**Perfect for getting started!**
